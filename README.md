## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Js



### What I learned

The big thing for me in this project wa sthe importantce of wrappers - especially with the smaller details like icons next to dropdown menus or similar.
Also decided to build custom hamburger menu/dropdown/mobile-nav, with the minimal help of google, just to understand the concepts of their creation.
